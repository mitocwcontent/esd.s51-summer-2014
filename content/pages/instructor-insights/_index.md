Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _ESD.S51 Systems Leadership and Management Praxis_ as it was taught by Michael Davies in Summer 2014.

SL&M (Systems Leadership and Management) Praxis is a course designed to introduce students to the dynamics of strategic decision making in corporate boardrooms through team exercises, simulations, and role playing. The case studies and team exercises introduce students to strategy choices in the high tech sector, but these learnings are just as valid in other industries. Invited guest speakers from the industry who have lived through difficult corporate situations provide insights into the cases discussed in class.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Learn how senior leadership teams in technology businesses make decisions
*   Become highly effective at making decisions in teams under time pressure, with incomplete and ambiguous information, and in the context of significant uncertainty

{{< quote "At the beginning … it was very scary to teach through role-play and simulation, because I didn’t know how it was going to go. It’s not a didactic form of pedagogy. You really have to think on your feet." "—Michael Davies" >}}

Assessment
----------

Grading for this class is on a Pass/Fail basis. All individual and team assignments are graded on a Complete/Incomplete scale.

There are, however, also significant prizes for competitive performance in the [online simulation exercises]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/instructor-insights/role-play-and-simulation), based on objective performance criteria. The finale of the course is a scenario-based exercise, called “War Games.” In this exercise, students work together in small teams to take on real-world problems of today and the near future. Business leaders participate in this exercise and evaluate the performance of each team.

Student Information
